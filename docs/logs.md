Bulbbot currently offers `7` logging types: `modaction`, `automod`, `messagelogs`, `rolelogs`, `memberlogs`, `channellogs` and `joinleave`

### Mod actions
Once enabled, `modaction` logging will log all mod actions performed by the bot in the selected channel. You can enable mod action logging using the
`!cfg modaction <channel>` command.

### AutoMod
`Automod` logging will log all AutoMod violations detected by Bulbbot in the selected channel. Bulbbot will additionally log which automated actions 
did it take and what was the detected content. You can configure AutoMod logging using the `!cfg automod <channel>` command.
